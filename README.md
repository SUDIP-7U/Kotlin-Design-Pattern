3 type of design pattern

🧩 1. Creational Patterns
Focus on object creation, abstracting the instantiation process.

Common Examples:
PatternDescriptionSingletonEnsures a class has only one instance.Factory MethodCreates objects without specifying the exact class.Abstract FactoryGroups related factories.BuilderStep-by-step object construction.PrototypeClones existing objects instead of creating new ones.

🔧 Use When: You want more control over object creation, or need to reuse expensive objects.

🏗 2. Structural Patterns
Focus on how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures.

Common Examples:
PatternDescriptionAdapterConverts one interface to another.DecoratorAdds behavior to objects at runtime.FacadeSimplifies a complex subsystem.ProxyActs as a substitute or placeholder.CompositeTreats individual and grouped objects uniformly.BridgeSeparates abstraction from implementation.

🧱 Use When: You want to organize or simplify relationships between classes or systems.

🧠 3. Behavioral Patterns
Focus on communication between objects and the flow of control.

Common Examples:
PatternDescriptionObserverOne-to-many dependency (e.g., LiveData in MVVM).StrategyEncapsulates interchangeable algorithms.CommandEncapsulates a request as an object.StateAllows an object to alter its behavior when its state changes.MediatorCentralizes communication between objects.Chain of ResponsibilityPasses requests along a chain of handlers.

🧠 Use When: You want objects to cooperate without being tightly coupled.
